# Join our journey to the cosmos
We are the Stellenbosch University Astronomy Society, and are affiliated with the Societies Council of Stellenbosch University.

The Society exists to foster academic interest and community engagement in the field of astronomy, and operates in line with Stellenbosch Universityâ€™s values and policies.

The vision of the Stellenbosch University Astronomy Society is to inspire students with the wonders of the night sky and foster the curiosity and appreciation of our cosmos that is within all of us. 

We aim to 
- create a space that is welcoming to all people, regardless of background, which will be both stimulating and fun.
- promote astronomical literacy, and connect members in the society with professional astronomers and astrophysicists in a friendly and informative atmosphere with ample opportunities for hands-on observing of celestial objects and enjoyable astronomy-themed meetups.

The website is currently under construction [here](https://koustav-konar.github.io/SU-Astro-Society.github.io/).
